# ledrama-gui

LED light configuration GUI

I DO NOT OWN THE CODE. VECTOR - Suomen Verkkopeliyhdistys ry does. Personal and demonstrative use allowed. The ColorPicker component is derivative work from @bamzc 's color picker that can be found at https://github.com/Bamzc/vue3-color-gradient-picker. Led-preview is mainly created by Samettipallo.

The software was commisioned by VECTOR as a non-paid educational university project that was done in group with 4 other people. The software was designed to be used with Node-RED's FlowFuse/FlowForge.

In this project my main contributions were
* Technical guidance to the Ledrama- ESP32 controller software, including multiple GUI and UX-related desicions
* Forming the correct MQTT-messages
* ArtNet support for the interface
* Backend flows (flows.json)
